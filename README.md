# Street Easy Parser

Street Easy Parser is a lightweight Ruby program that scrapes the most expensive sales and rental listings in the SOHO neighborhood from a search on streeteasy.com. The results are structured then stored in a JSON file. Street Easy Parser does not scrape directly from the website due to a 405 error.

## Installation

1. Run bundle install.
2. Run ruby lib/runner.rb
3. Open the resulting listings.json file.

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
